## 🎯 Introduction
Financial institutions operate within complex ecosystems comprising multiple interconnected system, applications and APIs. Testing these ecosystems often relies on static mock tools, leading to inefficiencies. The challenge is to develop a context aware testing system leveraging Generative AI to validate different financial ecosystems dynamically.
The solution provided makes an attempt to handle the use case of generating testcase from the contexts provided, by training and leveraging the capabilities of an AI model.

## 💡 Inspiration
Design and implement a context-aware testing system that can dynamically generate test case for financial transactions, customer interactions, Fraud detection, compliance and risk assessments.
## ⚙️ What It Does
The main components of the system are - AI model - Fine tuned FlanT5 model, Python module - main.py
The python module is started as a webserver so that it can accept and process the api requests.
From CLI run the command "python test_api.py" - this reads the context file and sends an api request with input as the contexts. The api mapped in main.py processes the request , invokes the model to generate the test cases.

## 🛠️ How We Built It
The system is built with python.
Below are the important modules.
AI Model FLAN-T5  - is an open-source, sequence-to-sequence, large language model, provided by the HuggingFace transformers library. The model was published by Google researchers in late 2022, and has been fine-tuned on multiple tasks. This is a transformer model for NLP, which excels in few shot learning. Since the volume of data sets were limited, we found Flan T5 as a better option. We have fine tuned this model specifically for generating BDD testcases. The inference from the model is obtained via a WEB API call. 
FASTApi - is a high-performing web framework for building APIs with Python. Here it is used to create an api end point ‘/predict’ which takes the contexts as input and outputs  the  testcases generated by the model
Contexts - are read from a text file.

## 🚧 Challenges We Faced
Describe the major technical or non-technical challenges your team encountered.
Initially tried with a spring boot application to send openAI api requests to generate test case.
The api key generated for free tier was not providing the results.
## 🏃 How to Run
1. Clone the repository  
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/ewfx/catfe-tech-conquerors.git
   ```
2. Install dependencies  
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run the project  
   ```sh
uvicorn main:app  - this is to start the webserver
python test_api.py
   ```
